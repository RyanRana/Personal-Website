# Personal-Website

This is a simple Personal Webpage.
It fetures a cool backdrop, and all my social media links.
Download this and edit template, it is really easy to use. To run use, index.html. To change the css, go to assets --> css --> main.css.
Everything is labeled so you can change it up and add your own data to the webpage.
